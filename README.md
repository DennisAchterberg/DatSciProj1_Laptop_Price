## About
This Data Science project serves as a very basic way for me to learn my way around KNIME, Python and Data Science in general. 
The Aim was to create as simple model to predict the prices of laptops based on their hardware. 
The Data is from Kaggle => https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asinow/laptop-price-dataset
